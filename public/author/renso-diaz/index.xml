      <description>Favicon is not very noticeable at first but if you are like me, it will stand out when you have a lot of tabs open in your browser. Frameworks like Angular come with their brand icon by default already but what about if we want to change it with our own icon.
Well look not further we will go into the details on how to do it step by step:</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first part of our journey, this is going to be a small series with multiple posts to help you dive right into Express framework and Node.js. Don’t worry if you don’t have any previous experience with Express or Node.js. This tutorial is designed with that in mind and will try to be as clear as possible. We will cover the backend logic only in this series and in the future we may also create another small tutorial on how to integrate a view engine like Pug, Ejs, etc.</description>
