      <description>Welcome back to part two of our Express tutorial, in this part we are going to talk about express file structure and what exactly I mean by file structure. Also we will go over how to create a configuration file and use it to change to different environments of development.
Express like many other NodeJS backend frameworks like restify, fastify, etc. Donâ€™t really come with a file structure that we have to follow, you can structure your backend application any way you like but for the purpose of this journey we will use a MVC design pattern.</description>
